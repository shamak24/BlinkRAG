Refund Policy

We offer a 30-day refund window from the date of purchase. If 30 days have gone by, unfortunately, we can’t offer you a refund.

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it.

Refunds (if applicable):
Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

If approved, your refund will be processed within 5–7 business days to your original payment method.

Late or missing refunds:
If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company; it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.

If you’ve done all of this and still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at refunds@example.com.
